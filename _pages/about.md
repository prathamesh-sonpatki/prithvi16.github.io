I am a full Stack developer based in Pune , India. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from Pune University. 

I am passionate about building stuff. I am a part of local Ruby community. I have built a wide variety of applications with Ruby on Rails at the backend and JQuery and ReactJS at the frontend.
